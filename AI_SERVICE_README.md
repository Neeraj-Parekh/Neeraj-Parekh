```

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from backend.app.services.next_gen_ai_service import NextGenAIService

# Initialize service
ai_service = NextGenAIService(
    redis_url="redis://localhost:6379",
    openai_api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Initialize AI models
await ai_service.initialize()

# Predict productivity
context = {
    "sleep_hours": 7.5,
    "exercise_minutes": 30,
    "stress_level": 4,
    "environment_score": 8
}

prediction = await ai_service.advanced_productivity_prediction(
    user_id="user_123",
    context=context
)

print(f"Predicted score: {prediction.predicted_score:.2f}")
print(f"Confidence: {prediction.confidence.value}")
```

### Task Breakdown

```python
task_description = """

including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training,
and deployment with real-time inference capabilities.
"""

breakdown = await ai_service.intelligent_task_breakdown(
    task_description=task_description,
    user_context={"experience_level": 0.8, "skills": ["python", "ml"]}
)

print(f"Complexity: {breakdown.complexity_score:.2f}")
print(f"Subtasks: {len(breakdown.subtasks)}")
print(f"Total duration: {breakdown.estimated_total_duration} minutes")
```
